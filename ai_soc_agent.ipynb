        "**Objective:**  \n",
        "An autonomous multi-agent system designed to automate Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows. It triages incoming alerts, performs real-time threat intelligence lookups, conducts web research, and generates professional incident reports to assist human analysts in rapid decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key features**:  \n",

        "Autonomous Investigation: The system doesn't just flag an alert; it investigates the reputation and context of the threat before alerting a human.\n",
